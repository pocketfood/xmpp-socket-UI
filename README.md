# xmpp-socket-UI
Send simple one way messages using Xmpp, express, ejs and sockets

`npm install && node app.js`

The websockets link to messages so you have to run the server send message from client in order to link with websocket. Thanks to carbon messaging all the messages coming from you will go to all of your devices in real time.

Node app.js then send a message from client to link with socket id. Once client is linked you can send messages from UI. 
This is not a bug.
